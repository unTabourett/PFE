ML process :

1. Decide on problem
What are we modeling

Why need ML?
Learning new physics 
Capture Expensive Physics > Surrogate modeling / > Fast & accurate / > automatic differentiation for optimization
Capturing multi physics interactions
update data with new data

2. Curate data
What data will inform the model ?
Rotate reshape. 
Infinite amounts of data > easy to find relation with all data for everywhere
Find the right angle. Heliocentrisme easy to learn =/= geocentric view

3. Design architecture. As easy as possible
RNN, autoencoder, DMD, SINDy

SINDy > Ajout de contraintes sur la simplicité du modèle.
Turbulent fluid flowsn, 
DL NN + DL allowing invariance to transformation, Ling, Kurzawski, Templeton, JFM
Inductive biases

4. Craft a loss function
What models are "Good"?
PINN standard DFeed forward NN, space time input output field. New metrics add norm, d/dt, d/dx, grad. Add regularizing loss term
Raissi, Perdikaris, Karniadakis

5. Employ Optimization
What algorithms to train model ?
Enforce physic. Add suggestions that we want physic to be satisfied.
Fluid flow : symetry, energy conserved. Add contraints to model error. Contraints least square

PI ML. Embed physics

Data-driven Science and engineering
AI institue in dynamic systems
